# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-ResNet18
This project utilizes a pre-trained ResNet-18 model for pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. It classifies images into Normal or Pneumonia using transfer learning, with a curated dataset divided into training and validation sets. The model is fine-tuned, robust, and evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
